# odin-recipes
This project is about creating a basic recipe website using HTML.
The three recipes of dishes that are included in this website are:
1. Naan
2. Paneer Butter Masala
3. Channa Masala
By the end of this project, I hope that I am able to use HTML elements and tags more comfortably and I am able to become more used to undertaking more projects as this is my very
first project.
