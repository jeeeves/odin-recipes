            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Now, let's get into the recipe!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour 2 cups of hot water to a bowl. Add 200 to 250 grams paneer cubes & rest for about 15 to 20 mins. Later drain the water and set aside. </li>
            <li>Pour 1 tablespoon oil to a hot pan. Add 2 green cardamoms & 1 cup cubed onions. Saute them on a medium flame till they turn transparent or lightly pink in color. This takes just 4 minutes. (Tip: If you do not have ginger garlic paste you may add the ¾ inch ginger (peeled & chopped) and 3 medium garlic cloves here.)</li>
            <li>Next add the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1½ cups finely chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon salt. Again saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Then cover the pan and cook till mushy.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When the tomatoes and onions are completely soft cooked & mushy, add the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>¾ to 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder (low heat variety)</li>
                <li>¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala (adjust to taste)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder (optional)</li>
                <li>12 to 14 cashews</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance the flavors)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Saute this onion tomato masala on a low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. It should begin to smell good and aromatic. Turn off the stove.</li>
            <li>Cool this completely and add to a blender. Pour 1 cup water. Blend this mixture to a super smooth puree. (Tip: To speed up the process, I pour ice cold water to the blender jar first and then transfer the warm mixture.)</li>
            <li>Blend to a very smooth & silky puree. If your blender is not powerful enough to make a fine puree, then strain it through a fine strainer to a bowl.</li>
        </ol>
            <p>You are done with making the gravy! Let's move on to making the paneer butter masala itself!</p>
        <ol>    
            <li>Heat a pan on a low flame with 1½ tbsp butter. When the butter melts, add all the following spices. You can leave them if you don’t have.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>2 green cardamoms</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>½ inch cinnamon</li>
                <li>3 cloves</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When the spices begin to sizzle, add 1½ teaspoon ginger garlic paste. Saute for 1 minute or until you begin to smell it good. The raw smell should go away.  Take care to cook this on a low to medium heat. Do not burn the paste. ((Note that you don’t need to add ginger garlic paste if you have used chopped ginger and garlic along with onions))</li>
            <li>Next pour onion tomato puree. I also added ¼ teaspoon red chili powder for deeper color. This is completely optional. Ensure the stove flame is at low else the curry begins to splatter.</li>
            <li>Immediately pour ½ cup water & mix well to bring it to a gravy consistency. If it is too thick you can add little more water.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on a medium flame until the gravy turns thick & flavorful.</li>
            <li>13. When the paneer butter masala gravy is ready, you will see traces of fats over the gravy. This is the color you may get. Open the lid and cook until the gravy turns thicker. Taste test and add more salt if needed</li>
            <li>14. Make sure the gravy reaches the desired consistency then add 200 to 250 grams paneer. Take 1 teaspoon kasuri methi in your palm and crush it between both your palms. Then add it to the butter masala. Avoid adding paneer when the gravy is still runny.</li>
            <li>Stir well. On a low flame cook covered just for 1 to 3 minutes. Cooking for longer can make the paneer harder. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons cream and stir. You should get this thick creamy texture as you see in the picture below.</li>
        </ol>
