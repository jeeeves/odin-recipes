            How to Make Channa Masala
        </h2>
        <p>
            Channa Masala is a chickpea curry originating in the Indian subcontinent. It is a staple dish in North Indian cuisine.
            This is one of the simpler Indian dishes you could make, so let's get right into the recipe!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here are the ingredients for making a good channa masala:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>45 ml grapeseed, coconut, or avocado oil</li>
            <li>200 g white or yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>7 g ground cumin</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp sea salt </li>
            <li>16 g garlic, minced</li>
            <li>12 g fresh ginger, minced</li>
            <li>30 g fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 fresh green chilies*, sliced with seeds</li>
            <li>7 g ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 (793-g) can puréed*, crushed, or finely diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (425-g) cans chickpeas, slightly drained</li>
            <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
            <li>2-3 tsp coconut sugar (or other sweetener of choice)</li>
            <li>30 ml lemon juice (plus more to taste // optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>Now let's look at how we make channa masala using all the ingredients we have.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, and one-third of the salt (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).</li>
            <li>Add garlic, ginger, cilantro, and green chilies to a mortar and pestle and grind into a rough paste (or use a small food processor to pulse into a paste. Alternatively, just finely mince.) Then, add to the pan with the onions.</li>
            <li>Next add ground coriander, chili powder, and turmeric and stir to coat. Add a little more oil at this point if the pan is looking dry.</li>
            <li>Next add pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and remaining salt (1/2 tsp as original recipe is written). If the mixture looks a little too thick, add up to 1 cup (240 ml) water (I added ~1/2 cup (120 ml) // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You’re looking for a semi-thick soup consistency at this point, as it will cook down into more of a stew.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, if you don’t have garam masala seasoning, make your own by adding (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) 2 small dried red chilies, 1 tsp black peppercorns (or 1/2 tsp ground black pepper), 1 tsp cumin seeds (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin), 1 tsp cardamom pods (or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom), 1/2 tsp cloves (or 1/4 tsp ground cloves), and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind/mix into a powder. Set aside.</li>
            <li>When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, chili powder for heat, or a bit of coconut sugar for sweetness and to offset the heat of the chilies.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and add lemon juice and garam masala. Stir to mix, then let cool slightly before serving. Fresh cilantro and lemon juice make an excellent garnish. Chana masala can be enjoyed as a stew on its own, or it can be delicious with white or brown rice or with naan, with the link to make it <a href="./naan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a>.</li>
