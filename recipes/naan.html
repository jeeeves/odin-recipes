        <h2>How to Make Naan</h2>
        <p>
            Naan is a leavened, oven-baked or tawa-fried flatbread., which is found in the cuisines mainly of 
            Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Caribbean.
            Naan is known for its pillowy texture and rich flavour. So, how do you actually get the pillowy texture?
            Well, the main component is yeast and it is one of the essential ingredients in making naan. Let's hop right into the recipe shall we?

            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <p>
            These are the ingredients that you need to make the perfect naan:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Ghee/Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Steps
        </h3>
        <p>
            And here is the recipe to follow:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix instant yeast with warm water and sugar – This is not a typical step you see in bread-making when using instant yeast. Usually the whole point of instant yeast is that you can add it straight into dough without mixing with warm water and letting it foam first.

                But, for naan, we found that blooming instant yeast in a warm water and sugar mixture (ie. letting it sit until it goes foamy) makes the naan fluffier and softer. It’s also an excellent safety test to ensure your yeast is still alive – nothing worse than discovering your yeast is dead once your bread is in the oven!
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave until foamy – Leave the mixture for 10 minutes until it becomes foamy, which means the yeast is alive and kicking. The warm water “wakes up” the yeast and the sugar helps too because yeast “eats” sugar to do its thing
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix dry and wet ingredients – In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt), then add the foamy yeast, butter / ghee, and the milk + eggs
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix – Start by mixing with a firm rubber spatula or a wooden spoon to bring the dough together. We use spoons for no reason other than saving a sticky mess on your hands!
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring together by hand – Once the mixture is too stiff to practically mix with a spatula, switch to hands. You don’t need to knead the dough, just mix it with your hands to bring it together into a cohesive dough
            </li>
            <li>
                The dough – Once the dough comes together, it should be sticky and soft enough to easily come together into a ball. But it should not be so sticky that the dough sticks to your hands. If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle over a little flour and work that in
            </li>
            <li>
                Proof dough – Once the butter / ghee is incorporated, shape dough into a ball. Cover with cling-wrap then put the bowl somewhere warm to let it proof – about 1 – 1.5 hours, until it has doubled in volume
            </li>
            <li>
                Doubled in volume – for me, at least, after proofing for 1 1/2 hours. It has actually more than doubled because it was a very (no really, a very!) hot day. It’s ok if it more than doubles – mine is probably closer to triple. But if the dough rises way too much (as in even more than triple), then the yeast can run out of oomph and not rise properly when cooked. Try to limit proofing to doubling in size!
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut into six pieces – Lift the dough out of the bowl on to a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces. This makes ~15 – 16 cm / 6 – 6.5″ diameter naans which are a nice individual serving size and comfortably cooked in a skillet
            </li>
            <li>
                Shape into balls – Make the top surface smooth by tucking the dough surface to the base
            </li>
            <li>
                Rise 15 minutes, 50% increase in size – Place the balls on a lightly floured tray, and cover loosely with a a lightweight tea towel (ie just place it on top, don’t tuck it tightly under the tray). Leave to rise in a warm place for 15 minutes until they increase in size by about 50%. It doesn’t take long
            </li>
            <li>
                After rising – Ready to roll out and cook!
            </li>
            <li>
                Flatten on lightly floured surface – Pick up a piece and flat it down lightly on a lightly floured surface 
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll out into  3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16″ thick rounds (about 16cm / 6.5″ wide). The thickness really affects the outcome. Too thin = crispier and not fluffy enough. Too thick and you won’t get the bubbles. We want the best of both worlds, ie. it should bubble up when cooked, be soft and fluffy inside and the naan itself should be floppy, not stiff.  3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16″ thick is the perfect thickness – so pull out that ruler! 
            </li>
            <li>
                Hot skillet – Heat a well-seasoned* cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until it is just starting to smoke. Then place the naan in and leave to cook without touching. If you’re like me, you’ll get a kick out of watching the surface blister up and go all bubbly – it’s an extremely satisfying moment!

* Well-seasoned skillets: If you maintain your cast iron skillets properly, they should be naturally non-stick and lightly greased! 😇 That’s all you need to make naan. But if it’s not, just pour 1/2 tsp vegetable oil on a paper towel then rub it over the base. Don’t pour the oil in, naan is not meant to be pan fried in oil, it’s “dry”-cooked.

I use a Lodge brand cast iron skillet – more on it here (excellent value, and indestructible!).

If using another type of skillet, do the same light oil rub. But you should not really be making naan in non-stick coated skillets – the high heat required destroys the non-stick coating!
            </li>
            <li>
                60 to 90 seconds cooking, then flip – It should only take 60 – 90 seconds for the underside to cook until it’s nicely browned. Then use tongs to turn
            </li>
            <li>
                After flip, 45 – 60 seconds more – The blistered side will only take around 45 seconds to cook. You’re just looking for a little charring on the blisters and for the surface of the second side to be cooked.

Aim for fast cooking (also as not to burn the ghee). The faster it cooks, the closer you get to real naan like that cooked in the fierce heat of a tandoor, and the fluffier your naan will be!

The slower it cooks, on the other hand, the less fluffy the naan will be. 2 to 2 1/2 minutes total is ideal. Beyond this, the naan will start to dry out inside and you’ll lose the signature texture; and finally
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush with ghee or butter (optionally also garlic – but yes you absolutely should!) –- Remove naan from the stove, then brush with melted ghee or butter while it’s still hot. Garlic is an optional extra, but it’s so good!

For an authentic finishing touch, add a sprinkle of nigella seeds for a delicious onion-y pops!
